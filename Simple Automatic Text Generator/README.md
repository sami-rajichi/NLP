# TP 3: Language Model - Automatic Text Generation

## Objective

The objective of this project is to automatically generate text using language models, specifically N-grams. We will be using the NLTK package and its features to achieve this task.

## Tasks to Accomplish

1. Generate a single sentence automatically from a small corpus and then modify it to generate a paragraph composed of 10 sentences.

2. Modify the code to calculate the probability of each generated sentence by calculating its perplexity.

3. Generate a language model, this time based on morphosyntactic tags. You can use either NLTK or spaCy to obtain morphosyntactic tags. Verify the generated sentences based on this model.

4. Apply different N-gram language models to generate a paragraph composed of 10 sentences using "the Reuters corpus" as the training data.

5. Provide the perplexity values for each method and compare the results.
