			<p>East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H. Hawksley, the present city CD head, believes. Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time. East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr. Hawksley, the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in being named a full-time director. </p>
			<p>Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program, Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director. He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs. </p>
			<p>Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job. One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin, he said. Along with a director, the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized. Mr. Hawksley said. One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program. Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said. </p>
			<p>Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks, similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station. He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area. Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack. </p>
